            <h2> Leslie </h2>
                <p> Hi! I'm Leslie, the "DeShaw" of "DeShaw & Co."! I'm a London native attending Fanshawe college. I'm currently presuing my diploma in Interactive Media Design. Outside of college, I work at a clothing store and a makeup store part-time! My hobbies include video games, music and art! It was my original goal to presue art, but I decided to do something with more transferable skills and just presue art as a hobby. I am excited to see where the future takes me!  </p>

                <h2> Charlee </h2>
                    <p>Charlee is the "Co." of "DeShaw & Co."! She enjoys to sit next to me when I'm at my computer doing work. Charlee's favourite things are her "baby" (a stuffed moose she enjoys to cuddle with), humans, and sniffing grass. Charlee is about to turn 10 in June but doesn't look a day over 5! She enjoys her treats and belly rubs she gets when she's a good girl, which is often! </p>
